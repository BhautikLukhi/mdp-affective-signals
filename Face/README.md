In this notebook, we hope you get a hands-on approach to the explore different modalities that are used in multimodal analysis of human behaviour. 
OpenFace creates a csv file that contains all features that have been extracted from the video. It should be present in the /Notebooks/processed/.
During the notebook you will use this generated csv to analyse your features.

A more detailed description of the features that are extracted can be found [here](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Output-Format)
